Both Roles Share Access To:
✅ Admin Dashboard (/admin)
✅ View all orders
✅ Update order status
✅ Update existing products (edit product details)

✅ Upload product images (Cloudinary integration)

Superadmin Exclusive Permissions:
🔐 Critical Operations:

POST /api/admin/products
Only superadmins can add new products to the catalog
Delete Products (

)
DELETE /api/admin/products/:id
Including automatic cleanup of associated Cloudinary images
Prevents accidental data loss by regular admins

Architecture Notes:
Backend enforcement: All permissions are enforced at the API level via [
roleCheck.ts
](file:///d:/personal/Projects/Riyas/TNtrends%20Ecommerce/Site2/backend/src/middleware/roleCheck.ts) middleware
requireAdmin = allows both admin + superadmin
requireSuperAdmin = allows only superadmin
Unified UI: Both roles use the same dashboard with the same navigation (features are hidden/disabled based on role in the frontend)
Use Case Scenario:
Admins: Day-to-day operations like updating stock, processing orders, editing product info
Superadmins: Strategic control - adding new product lines, removing discontinued items, configuring pricing rules
This setup prevents regular admins from making destructive changes (deletions) or structural changes (new products/settings) while still allowing them to handle daily operations efficiently. 🎯
